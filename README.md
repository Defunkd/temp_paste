Good

Anna Hello Client. how are you today? Allow me a short while to type the answer of your question.

Client Hi Anna

Anna How may I assist you?

Client I am wondering about your VPN service, how private it is

Anna Very private as long as nothing illegal activity is involved

Client Sure, ok.

So you don't log usage?

Anna There are two types of logs: Browsing Logs and Network (Systems) Logs.
Browsing logs are extremely personal and private to users, which we believe no one should log or have access to, since they have the potential to directly invade users’ privacy. This is clearly stated in our Privacy Policy and we reiterate that we DO NOT keep your personal and private Internet browsing logs.
Network logs, on the other hand, are pure system/troubleshooting logs with no necessary knowledge of browsing habits or other personal activities. These logs, among other system logs, contain mostly the timestamps of users, which includes non-VPN IP address.
Every VPN provider generates connections logs or timestamps (of your non-VPN IP addresses), because this is how networks and servers work by default. Storing these logs post generation is where the entire debate currently is.

Client You had that ready in a macro?

Are you asked this a lot Anna?

Anna Yes.

Client OK. Thank you. Have a wonderful day.

Anna Welcome

But do read the details above

Client pasting to a text file now.

Anna 2. Do Network (System) logs give away your privacy?
Not at all. By design they can't. Think of it like this: Network Logs are only have half of the picture.
We don’t have access to the other half unless you intentionally indulge in attacking, hacking, abusing, threatening or other similar unethical activity (as detailed in our Terms of Service) to such an extent that the victim files a complaint against you (as happened in the recent FBI case where Mr. Lin got involved in completely unethical and in-human behavior).
When authorities reach out to us, they usually provide us the timestamp of IP address(s) of an attack on a victim (That’s the other half which we otherwise couldn’t have).
Network logs are then searched at our end and whoever was using that provided IP address on that particular provided time stamp is identified as the alleged abuser.

Also past this one

Client You have a lot of people referencing that case with Lin?

Anna Yeah

Client :/

Sorry..

Anna No problem. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you require further assistance.

Client Were you forced to give the logs to FBI re: Lin?

Anna We were presented a warrant signed by the federal judge

Client You could have refused, citing 4th AMDT

Anna On our page tof terms of use we clearly mention that no illegal activity is supported and any court order signed by the judge might lead to revealing the information available

Client He was doing monstrous things, I absolutely agree. Read

Anna4:25 am So dear no organization can support crime

Client From what I have read. No excuse for what he did. OK I understand. I won't take up anymore of your time, thank you Anna. Have a nice day.Delivered
